   @brief Compute sun position for a given date/time and longitude/latitude.

   @details This is a simple Objective-C port of the "PSA" solar positioning algorithm, as documented in:
   Blanco-Muriel et al.: Computing the Solar Vector. Solar Energy Vol 70 No 5 pp 431-441.
   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0038-092X(00)00156-0

   According to the paper, "The algorithm allows .. the true solar vector to be determined with an accuracy of 0.5
   minutes of arc for the period 1999â€“2015."
